# Vise Network – Open Sourced for a Reason ❤️

Welcome to the official GitHub profile of **Vise Network**, Dubai’s premier Minecraft PvP server. We're building a fast-paced, competitive Minecraft experience for players in the MENA region.

### 🌐 Why Open Source?
We believe great servers are built by communities. By sharing parts of our core infrastructure, we invite developers, players, and enthusiasts to:
- **Contribute to innovation**
- **Learn from real-world plugin architecture**
- **Improve performance for low-ping, high-action PvP**
- **Spot and fix issues faster**

### 👀 What We Try To Share
- Internal Bukkit/Spigot/Paper plugins
- Matchmaking, dueling, queuing, and leaderboards
- Velocity/BungeeCord utilities
- Tools for region-based server optimizations

### 🚀 Built for Dubai. Built for Speed.
Our server is optimized for low latency in the UAE and surrounding regions, with a competitive mindset and quality-of-life features for serious players.
